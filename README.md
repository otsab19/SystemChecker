LangChain/LangGraph Learning Journey
This repository is where I'm documenting my journey as I learn and explore LangChain and LangGraph, two powerful frameworks for building applications with large language models (LLMs).



Foundational LangChain concepts:
Getting started with LLMs and prompt templates.
Understanding different types of Chains (like LLMChain, SequentialChain, etc.).
Working with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Exploring Agents and Tools.
LangGraph for advanced workflows:
Building stateful graphs.
Defining nodes and edges.
Implementing custom agents and loops.
Examples of multi-turn conversations and decision-making systems.
Practical projects and use cases:
(Coming soon!) Simple applications demonstrating the power of these frameworks.
Getting Started (for those who want to follow along)
